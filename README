  Here is a simple framework that I created during my 5th semester 
at MIPT. It was created to solve the problem of processing the results 
of an experiment (or analyzing a data set, if You like) like laboratory 
work in physics. In addition to the main task, I used it to study 
python on my own. The framework can be used as a module for writing 
your own scripts or as a completed program, the operation of which is 
set using configuration files. In the future, there will be a description 
and examples of using this framework in real laboratory work. For now, 
only comments in the code are available.
